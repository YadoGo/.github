The main goal of this final bootcamp project is to save you time and money when searching for a hotel for your travels. By gathering information from multiple hotel websites, the service provides users with a more efficient way to find cost-effective and suitable options for their travel needs. As a result, the project becomes a valuable tool for those who want to make the most of their travel experience without worrying about extensively searching for the best accommodation deals.
